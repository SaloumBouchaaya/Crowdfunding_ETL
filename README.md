# Crowdfunding_ETL

###In this project I worked to extract an excel file, clean the data, & create multiple dataframes.
###From there I extracted those dataframes into indvidual CSV files and created a SQL schema to create tables from that data. 
###You can find all data cleaning, analysis, schema, resources, and picture proof of the tables in PgAdmin

###Data provdided by UC Berkely Data Analytics edX Bootcamp
